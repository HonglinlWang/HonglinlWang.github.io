A data-driven personal website
======
I’m a first-year Master’s student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ICT/CAS](http://www.ict.ac.cn/)), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fei Sun](https://ofey.me/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree at Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)).

My research interest lie in **NLP**, **Trustworthy AI**, and **Recommender System**.

You may find my CV here: [Honglin Wang’s Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_Honglin_Wang.pdf).
